Below is a simplified list of commands to use the script (s.py) for various tasks, 
formatted as plain text for easy copying into a text file. 
These commands assume you have the script and dependencies (ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp, gallery-dl) installed, 
and your videos or URLs are prepared.

# 1. Convert existing videos to Universal format (batch_convert mode)
python s.py batch_convert ./videos --output-dir ./converted

# 2. Download videos in Universal format (all submode, without keeping original)
python s.py download all --output-dir ./output

# 3. Download videos in Original format (all submode, keeping original with H.264/AAC conversion if needed)
python s.py download all --output-dir ./output --keep-original

# 4. Download only audio (audio submode)
python s.py download audio --output-dir ./output

# 5. Download only video without audio (video submode)
python s.py download video --output-dir ./output

# 6. Download pictures (pic submode)
python s.py download pic --output-dir ./output

# 7. Download and split video into video and audio (split submode)
python s.py download split --output-dir ./output

# 8. Combine video and audio files (combine mode)
python s.py combine ./videos/V1 ./audio/A1 --output-dir ./combined

# 9. Create a slideshow from images (slide mode, 5-second delay per image)
python s.py slide 5 ./pictures/P1 ./pictures/P2 --output-dir ./slideshow

# 10. Loop an audio file to a specified duration (loop mode, 15 seconds)
python s.py loop ./audio/A1 15 --output-dir ./looped

# 11. Download with authentication (using username/password or cookies, example) (for Threads but didn't get to work)
python s.py download all --output-dir ./output --username your_username --password your_password
python s.py download all --output-dir ./output --cookies ./cookies.txt

# 12. Clear output directory before downloading (clear-dir option)
python s.py download all --output-dir ./output --clear-dir

Notes for Usage
Paths: Replace ./videos, ./output, ./pictures/P1, etc., with the actual paths to your directories and files.
If the output path doesn't exist one will be created in the same folder as the script.

Dependencies: Ensure ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp, and gallery-dl are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

urls.txt: For download mode, you need a urls.txt file in the same directory as the script with URLs 
(one per line or separated by semicolons).

Testing: Start with a small set of files or URLs to verify the commands work as expected before processing large batches.

You can copy the above text into a file (e.g., commands.txt) and reference it when running the script. 
If you need further clarification or run into issues, let me know!
